I need a portfolio page? Sure, I'll just whip that up in plain HTML and CSS. Pure.

That is what I thought until I found myself inputing the same set of tags, the same set of CSS selectors, again and again. Boring.

I don't need the fancy tool-chain but since I already have a few lying about, I decided to go full React. So that's what we've got here.
